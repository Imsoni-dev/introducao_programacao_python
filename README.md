# Introduction to programming with Python
Below is a series of exercises from the book "Introduction to Programming with Python" by Nilo Ney Coutinho Menezes.  I propose to do the exercises contained in the book as a way of practicing the concepts of programming logic and at the same time learning the Python programming language.  The concepts will be of great use to beginners, concepts ranging from variables to classes, with a special touch of SQLite as the icing on the cake.  The concepts presented will be: -Variables -Conditions -Repetitions -List, dictionary, tuples and sets -Strings -Functions -Files -Classes and Objects.
